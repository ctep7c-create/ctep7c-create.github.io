<h3><strong>Purpose & Goals</strong></h3>
<p>I aim to spark creativity, interdependence, and joy through my work. By embracing diversity of thought and experience, I strive to make a positive difference in the world. My goal is to cultivate learning environments that empower individuals to thrive and contribute their unique talents to our collective growth and understanding.
