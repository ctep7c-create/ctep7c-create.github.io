<h2><strong>Biography</strong></h2>
<!--Adding comments in are helpful for yourself and future viewers of your code. They are also really helpful when it come to debugging your code.-->
<p>I am currently working as an Academic Support Coordinator for Supplemental Instruction and Tutoring at the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC), where I also serve as the Assistant Director and Certified Trainer for the International Center for Supplemental Instruction. Holding a Bachelor of Arts in Spanish and Psychology from UMKC, I am passionate about empowering students to achieve their academic goals and providing professional development opportunities that will help them long after they graduate.
In my current role, I support the development and implementation of academic support programs that encourage collaborative learning, and I am dedicated to advancing the effectiveness of supplemental instruction across campus. My work at the International Center for Supplemental Instruction allows me to make an impact on an international level, and I was recently promoted to Assistant Director, a role I assumed in June 2024.</p>
