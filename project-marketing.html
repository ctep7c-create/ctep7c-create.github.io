    <h2>Marketing</h2>
    <div class="box"><p>In any field, it is important to make data-informed decisions to meet your goals. In my role as an Academic Support Coordinator, I was tasked with creating a quarterly newsletter/annual report to showcase the qualitative and quantitative data regarding our Supplemental Instruction and Tutoring programs each semester. The type of data shown includes the mean GPAs of students who use these services versus students who don’t, written feedback from the students who do use these services, and how student leaders working in these roles gain transferable skills that can be applied in any career pathway. This report allows for key stakeholders to see the impact of academic support and how to adapt to the needs of the students being served. Post-covid, there was a period of time where virtual opportunities for engagement were preferred but within the past two years, there has actually been a trend at our institution for more in-person opportunities. I have also seen trends where students regularly request support for specific courses more in the fall semester as opposed to the spring, which allows us to determine how many student leaders are needed each semester to support a singular course. Being able to adapt accordingly is so important and this also includes other marketing options. Some students mentioned in feedback forms that they were unable to figure out how to access these resources so, to increase awareness, we created social media accounts and regularly featured our student leaders, SI session/tutoring information and study tips. We also made sure to regularly visit classes to advertise our services and connect with not only the students but the faculty as well. Lastly, we increased the number of workshops hosted each semester to provide additional opportunities for engagement.</p></div>
