    <p>Serving as Assistant Director of the ICSI means participating in the planning of the International Conferences on Supplemental Instruction, which take place every two years. So far, I have had the opportunity to help plan one full conference (Baltimore 2024), and am currently planning our next conference (Portland 2026). This means serving as the Chair of a conference committee (keynotes, proposals, marketing, climate, awards, sponsorships). This year, I am the chair of the Climate & Participant Engagement committee and also one of three members on the Marketing committee. My role includes curating excursions for each day of the conference, creating a volunteer schedule based on the news of the other committees, creating networking opportunities within the conference schedule, and also marketing any relevant conference news across various listserv, newsletters, and social media platforms. Typically, there are around 400 attendees at the conference each year, post-covid. We are currently looking to increase the number and type of attendees who are upper-level administrators, from other peer academic support programs, or use the SI model in their training. Overall, the main goal of the committee chair is to help contribute to creating an enjoyable experience for key stakeholders. These stakeholders are both students leaders and oftentimes, their supervisors. Previously, I was the Chair of the Awards committee and was tasked with creating the nomination form with my committee along with the qualifications for each award type. Then, we would choose the winners and invite them to serve on a panel sharing their knowledge to conference goers. This was such a great experience as it gave others in the field ideas on how to improve their programs, feeding into the collaborative nature of Supplemental instruction.</p></div>
