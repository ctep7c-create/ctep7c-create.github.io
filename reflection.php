          <p>Growing up, I was often shy about my unique perspective and interests, but over time, I’ve learned to embrace them as strengths that shape how I move through the world. Today, I lead with authenticity and creativity — committed to nurturing a passion for education, celebrating self-expression, and promoting inclusive practices in everything I do. I find purpose in sparking connection, curiosity, and joy through my work, always striving to make a meaningful difference, one project and opportunity at a time.</p>

          <p>Community involvement plays a key role in my personal and professional life. As an active member of the Greater Kansas City chapter of ABWHE (Association of Black Women in Higher Education), I help manage our social media presence and collaborate with others to amplify the voices, stories, and experiences that make our organization so powerful. I’m passionate about creating spaces, both digital and in-person, where people feel seen, valued, and empowered to grow.</p>

          <p>Professionally, I serve as the Academic Support Coordinator for UMKC’s Supplemental Instruction and Tutoring programs, and I’m also one of the Assistant Directors at the International Center for Supplemental Instruction. These roles have allowed me to support students, faculty, and staff while building strong, collaborative relationships across campus and beyond. I also enjoy using social media as a tool to share knowledge and foster engagement within learning communities. I earned my B.A. in Psychology and Romance Languages and Literature with an emphasis in Spanish from UMKC in 2019 and am currently taking graduate courses at the University of Missouri. I plan to enroll in the Learning Technologies and Design program to further expand my work in this space.</p>

          <p>With a strong foundation in education and student support, I’m excited to deepen my knowledge in instructional design, e-learning accessibility, and the ever-evolving world of educational technology. I’m especially interested in creating inclusive digital learning environments that foster belonging, spark curiosity, and support lifelong learning. Through creative and intentional design, I hope to build tools and experiences that reflect the diverse needs of today’s learners, helping individuals and communities thrive in both traditional and virtual spaces.</p>
